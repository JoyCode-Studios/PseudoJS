# PseudoJS

**Parser and tooling for `.jps` files â€” a clarity-first pseudo code format built for modular planning and branded continuity.**

This project contains the core TypeScript modules for parsing, validating, and supporting `.jps` files. Itâ€™s designed for personal use and internal JoyCode workflows, with a focus on minimalism, intentional structure, and frictionless execution.
